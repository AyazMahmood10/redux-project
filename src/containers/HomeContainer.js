//This container is a component which we will use to map the app.js file and the other home component. We won't directly import the HomeComponent to App so that we can import it to HomeContainer and from there we can transfer it to App and also we can connect it to redux

import React from "react";
import HomeComponents from "../components/HomeComponents";

export default HomeComponents
